# MERN:

MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) is an open-source JavaScript software stack used for building dynamic web sites and web application.

MERN is a full-stack solution, including front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).

MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node), where the traditional Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js.
Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any front-end JavaScript framework can work.

Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON.

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node:
- MongoDB
    - A document-based open source database
    - JSON documents created in your React.js front end can be sent to the Express.js server, where they can be processed and (assuming theyâ€™re valid) stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval
    - For cloud-native applications, MongoDB Atlas makes things easier by giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on the cloud provider of your choice

- Express(.js)
    - A web application framework for Node.js (i.e. server-side framework)
    - Express allows to easily create a web server
- React(.js)
    - A client-side JavaScript framework (i.e. a front-end library to build UI)
    - React lets you build UI through simple components, connect them to data on your back-end server, and render them as HTML
- Node.js
    - An open-source, cross-platform, back-end development platform that runs on a JavaScript Engine and is used for executing JavaScript code server-side (i.e. server-side JavaScript applications)
    - A JavaScipt run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server)
    - The premier JavaScript web server
    - Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications
