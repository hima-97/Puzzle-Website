-   Git (Install Here: https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   Node and npm (Install Here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
    - nvm (node version manager) is a tool that allows you to download and install Node.js.
        - nvm allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js installed on your system
        - nvm was originally developed for Linux systems, however nvm-windows can be installed for Windows with the following steps: <br>

    - npm (node package manager) is the package manager for Node.js and allows you to install javascript packages
        - npm is included with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed then most likely you have npm installed as well

## Installation Steps

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hima-97/Puzzle-Website.git
```

Run npm install in the server directory:

```sh
cd server
npm install
```

Run npm install in the client directory:

```sh
cd client
npm install
```

Run the app by using one terminal for server and one terminal for client:

```sh
cd server
npm run server

The frontend should run on localhost:3000, and the backend should run on localhost:5000.
